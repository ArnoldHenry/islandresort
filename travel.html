      Widely acclaimed as Australia’s Galapagos, Kangaroo Island is
      home to an abundance of native wildlife and spectacular natural
      attractions. Covering almost 4,500 square kilometres it is
      Australia’s third largest island and offers the best of the
      mainland on a smaller, more intimate scale. With more than one
      third of the island declared as Conservation or National Park,
      visitors readily come face-to-face with prolific bird and animal
      species such as New Zealand fur seals, koalas, kangaroos, Australian
      sea lions, ospreys, echidnas and much, much more. Flanked by the
      indomitable Southern Ocean, dramatic coastal vistas and sculptured
      landscapes lay unspoiled by development and riddled with sheer limestone
      cliffs, sheltered coves, rocky headlands and deserted stretches of sugar-white sand.
      Against this stunning natural backdrop rests a distinguished epicurean culture,
      ably supported by a profusion of fresh seafood, unique local produce and the
      acclaimed vignerons of South Australia’s Coonawarra, Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale,
       Adelaide Hills and Clare Valley regions. A veritable feast for the senses, Kangaroo
       Island is a beacon for discerning travellers wishing to experience the very essence of
       Australia.
