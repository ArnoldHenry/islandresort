      A signature itinerary of selected guided island excursions is designed daily and
      included in the tariff, allowing guests to encounter abundant wildlife in a ‘zoo
      without fences’ and discover the Island’s unique natural attractions, often with
      exclusive access and always with a touch of luxe.The Southern Ocean Lodge guide
      introduces sea lions at Seal Bay, hosts an exploration of the vast wilderness of
      Flinders Chase National Park and leads a journey through coastal flora along the
      limestone clifftops. A menu of Bespoke Experiences offers further exploration and
      excellent private charters are also available. Discover epicurean delights, visit
      local artists, or step off the beaten track to encounter wildlife in Australia’s
      own Galapagos.
